        <p>I love helping others achieve their goals by making them
            more efficient at their jobs. I develop tools that automate tasks
            & create streamlined processes that increase your productivity and
            reduce timely, costly errors. My background is in the field of
            psychology -- I've worked closely in the field of Industrial Organizational psychology
            but also have experience in behavior analyaiss, assessment research & design & the interaction
            of genetics & behavior. In my free time I enjoy reading ,
            hiking, refurbishing old furniture, and anything that has to do with spoiling my dog Oakley.
            I've recently gotten back into group fitness & have enjoyed Orange Theory workouts and am
            training for my first half-marathon</p>
